A supply convoy is moving through the area!

\item{\bf Attacker:} You \emph{need} those supplies.
\item{\bf Defender:} The supplies must get through.
\end{squishitemize}

\subsection{\bf The Battlefield}%

The winner of the deployment zone roll off chooses a table edge and
the other player takes the opposite.  The defender's deployment zone
is the~12'' strip along their table edge.  The attacker's deployment
zone is the 6'' strips along both side edges of the battlefield, up to
9'' away from the defender's deployment zone.

\subsection{\bf Mission Rules}%

%The attacker plays first.  The defender may not Seize the Initiative.

At the start of their deployment, the defender gains a Bulldog convoy
vehicle for their army:

  \noindent\textbf{Smoke Launchers (4).} Up to four times per game, the
  Bulldog may use its smoke launchers in your shooting phase.  If you
  do so, your opponent must subtract~1 from all hit rolls against this
  model from shooting attacks until your next turn.

  \noindent\textbf{Advanced Repair Systems.}  Roll a D6 at the start of each
  of your turns; on a 6 the Bulldog regains up to two lost wounds.

  \noindent\textbf{On Assignment.}  The Bulldog is taken to have
  whatever faction keywords are shared by all of the units in your
  army list (all of the partners' lists in team games).

  If destroyed, leave the wrecked Bulldog model in place.  The
  Bulldog, or its wreck, act as an objective marker.  While not
  destroyed the defender controls it by default if there are no
  attacker models within 3''.
