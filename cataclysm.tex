\missionheading{Assault Phase}

In the assault phase, the alliances alternate selecting combats to be
resolved beginning with the currently active team.  This ensures the
current team cannot solely resolve their preferred combats before time
runs out for the turn.  In game terms, assaults are resolved in order
one-by-one, as usual. In practice, assaults that cannot affect each
other should be resolved simultaneously as possible.

Units may charge as usual into ongoing close combats including units
from multiple other alliances.  Combats are resolved in the assault
phase of each alliance with engaged units, making combats with more
than two alliances particularly deadly!
