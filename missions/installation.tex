  A critical outpost, command center, supply warehouse, or temple has
  come under siege!

{\bf Attacker:} You must destroy it and control the site.

{\bf Defender:} You must protect the installation.

\missionheading{The Battlefield}%

Deployment zones are 12'' from opposing table edges, with the attacker
choosing and the defender taking the opposite.  Before their
deployment, the defender's army gains a small building fortification.

\missionheading{Mission Rules}%

Initiative applies.  The building cannot be placed within~6'' of any
table edge.  It has armor~11 on each facing,~3 hull points, a
