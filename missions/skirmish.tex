\begin{columns}

  Vanguards patrolling the outskirts of their main forces have crashed
  into each other---contact is made!

  \textbf{Attacker} and \textbf{Defender} roles are identical in this
  mission and have no effect in-game.

\missionheading{The Battlefield}%

% A variety of ruins, woods, and other terrain should be placed to
% cover a quarter to a half of the board evenly and roughly
% symmetrically.

Deployment zones are diagonal table corners, up to~12'' from the
centerline between them.  Roll off to determine who chooses a corner
and their player table edge, the other player taking the opposite.

Place objective markers at the center of the table and the centers of
the two table quadrants opposite the deployment zone corners.
