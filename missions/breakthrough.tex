\section{Mission: Breakthrough}

  Opposing forces thrust and counter-thrust to break up or hold
  battlefield positions.
  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item {\bf Attacker:} You must pierce the enemy's lines.
  \item {\bf Defender:} Hold your ground.
  \end{squishitemize}

\subsection{\bf The Battlefield}%

Deployment zones are~12'' from opposing table edges.

\subsection{\bf Mission Rules}%

At game end, victory points are earned as follows:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item The defender earns~2 victory points for each quarter of their
  army by number of models that has not been removed as a casualty,
  rounding down (i.e., less than~25\% is worth no points).

\item The defender earns~1 victory point if no enemy models are in
  their table half.

\item The attacker earns~1 victory point for each quarter of their
  army by models that has not been removed as a casualty, rounding
  down.

\item The attacker earns~1 victory point for each quarter of their
  starting army by models that is at least partially within 6'' of the
  defender table edge, rounding up (i.e., having at least~1 model
  within 6'' of the defender edge is worth a point).

\end{squishitemize}
