\section{The Cataclysm}

\begin{columns}
  
  All of the recon squads have crossed paths as they fight toward
  their final missions!

  The alliance with fewer total points earned in the Recon Squad
  matches is the {\bf Defender}, and the other the {\bf Attacker}.

  \subsection{Heroes}

  Each Recon Squad's specialists that are not already Characters are
  elevated to such and improve their wounds characteristics by~1,
  except the leader, which improves their wounds characteristic by~2.
  The leader is considered an HQ unit as well as their original
  battlefield role, and must be their player's warlord, gaining a
  trait as usual.  Before any deployment begins both alliances
  simultaneously declare one of their warlords to be their warmaster.

  \subsection{The Battlefield}

  Deployment zones are the areas up to~12'' from the long edges of the
  battlefield (Dawn of War).  The defender chooses a zone and the
  attacker takes the other.  Beginning with the defender, the
  alliances alternate placing primary objective markers in their own
  deployment zones up to~3 each, for a total of~6 on the battlefield.
  Beginning with a defender and alternating between the alliances,
  each player then places a secondary objective marker outside their
  deployment zone.

  Deployment begins with the defender and proceeds as usual for
  Matched Play.

  \subsection{Endgame}

  The Cataclysm ends after battle round~5.

  \subsection{Scoring}

  Objective markers are scored after each game turn: Primaries award
  the current turn number in victory points, while secondaries award~1
  victory point.

  % \begin{itemize}
  % \item Primaries award the current turn number in victory points;
  % \item Secondaries award~1 victory point.
  % \end{itemize}

  Alliances gain~2 victory points if the opposing warmaster is removed
  as a casualty, and~1 victory point for each other opposing warlord
  eliminated.

  First Blood and Linebreaker both apply as in the standard Eternal
  War missions.

  % The first unit (including single models) to be removed in its
  % entirety for any reason yields~1 victory point to the opposing
  % alliance for first blood.  If an alliance has any scoring units in
  % its opponent's deployment zone at game end then it scores~1 victory
  % point for linebreaker.

  Whichever alliance scores the most victory points wins a tactical
  victory in the Cataclysm, while the alliance that has more players
  achieve their legacy objectives wins a strategic victory.
