\section{Mission: Battlefield}


The war grinds on interminably, all notion of battle lines lost in
confusion and exhaustion.

\begin{squishitemize}
\item \textbf{Attacker} and \textbf{Defender} roles are identical in
  this mission and have no effect in-game.
\end{squishitemize}

\subsection{\bf The Battlefield}%

The winner of a~D6 roll off chooses a table corner.  Their deployment
zone is the quarter circles of all points within~12'' of that corner
as well as the \emph{diagonally} opposite corner.  The other player's
deployment zone is the~12'' quarter circles from the other corners.

Place a single objective marker at table center.
