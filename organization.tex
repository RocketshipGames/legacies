\section{Organization}

\begin{columns}

  This section is for organizers, describing how to conduct a
  \emph{Legacies} campaign.

\subsection{Campaign Schedule}

Recon Squad matches can be played in about~60 minutes, not including
setup.  The Cataclysm takes about~4 hours.  It's feasible to run
\emph{Legacies} over either several evenings or a single day, e.g.:

\subsection{Alliances \& Story}

At the start of the campaign, the players are organized into two
alliances with an equal number of players.  In some groups this might
be faction specific, e.g., Chaos Daemons versus Eldar.  Generally
though an alliance will be comprised of several factions and can be
given a less specific title such as the Forces of Order, Legions of
Discord, or the Spoiler Horde.  How players are assigned alliances is
up to the organizer.  In a large event with mostly strangers and
tournament leanings it might be simply random.  In more
narrative-oriented and casual settings some attempt should be made to
account for thematic cohesiveness and team skill balance.

The concept behind the campaign is that each recon squad is a team of
veterans or other distinguished warriors tasked with several special
operations as part of a larger battle or war.  In the course of those
missions their paths eventually all cross, resulting in the larger
final battle.  Any specific background story is up to the organizer
and players, enabling a range of narratives with more or less detail.

\subsection{Setup}

In advance of the campaign, players should be pointed to the Recon
Squad rules and the Missions section of this packet so they can design
their Recon Squad and Cataclysm army lists.  The campaign is themed
around players fielding a single Recon Squad list throughout, but the
organizer should feel free to be flexible about that requirement if
they wish.  In a campaign run over multiple days there is no need to
require Cataclysm lists be finalized until the last event.

Preparing for the campaign is very simple.  For each of the two
alliances, print and cut apart enough sets of the~8 legacy cards in
the Missions section to have at least one card per player.  Also print
and cut apart enough sets of the~8 mission sheets to have one for each
match.  For up to~16 players this means two sets of legacy cards and
one set of mission sheets.

With anything but a very small number of players, it's probably easier
to have players record results separately from the mission sheets,
especially as the latter might be used again.  In that case, print and
cut apart enough copies of the scorecards at the end of this section
to have one for each match.  If using the scoring mechanism described
here, also print and cut apart enough copies of the ballots and
tickets to have one painting ballot per player and as many
sportsmanship tickets as might be necessary. Finally, print out one
copy of the Cataclysm scoresheet and as many copies of the players
scoresheet as needed.

%A spreadsheet is available on the
%\underline{\href{http://rocketshipgames.com/40k/legacies/}{\emph{Legacies}
%    website}}.

\subsection{Legacies}

After being assigned an alliance, each player chooses a legacy.  No
legacy may be selected twice within an alliance until all legacies
have been chosen at least once, and so on if there are even more
players.  Otherwise the alliance members may discuss among themselves
how to divy up the legacies.  If there is any contention, either ask
the players in random order to choose, or randomly assign legacies.

Each legacy lists three Recon Squad Missions and gives a Cataclysm
objective and legacy bonus.  To achieve their legacy, players must
accomplish the Cataclysm objective in the final team battle.  If they
win at least two of the three Recon Squad Missions in the given role
of attacker, defender, or either, then they receive their legacy bonus
in the Cataclysm.

Players' chosen legacies, match results, and whether or not they are
succeeding at their missions are all public information throughout the
campaign.

\subsection{Recon Squad Rounds}

Recon Squad match pairings are made strategically by the alliances to
help their players achieve their legacy missions and further their
collective strategic goals.  The alliances alternate nominating one of
their remaining unpaired players along with a mission and role
(attacker or defender).  The opposing alliance then responds with a
player for the match, who takes the other mission role and chooses an
unclaimed game board to play on.  This player must be in the same or
best similar win/draw/loss bracket as the nominated player, unless the
number of players is not great enough to do so without
repeating pairings.

For the first round, the initial alliance to put a player forward is
determined either randomly, by the background story, or the outcomes
of connected preceding events.  In subsequent rounds the alliances
alternate making the initial nomination.

%   they'd done to his world.  But most of all, he hated them for
%   teaching him to hate.
%\end{story}%
%\bigskip

Players should use the checkboxes on their legacy cards to record
victories toward the Recon Squad Mission requirements, in addition to
the organizer keeping track.  It does not matter if the player was
nominated or the responding opponent, and they do not have to complete
the missions in any order.  In order to get their legacy bonus in the
Cataclysm they simply have to win each mission in the required role at
some point in the campaign.  Similarly, a player can attempt a mission
and role pair multiple times.  However, no advantage is gained by
winning the same mission and role pair multiple times.

\subsection{Cataclysm}

Following the four rounds of Recon Squad games, the campaign concludes
by pitching the two teams against each other directly in the
Cataclysm.  Each player essentially adds~300 points to their Recon
Squad, as detailed in the mission rules.


\paragraph{Board.}  The table for the Cataclysm game should be~4'
wide as usual, and roughly as many feet long as there are players in
the campaign.  So an~8-player campaign would conclude on an 8'x4'
table.  One idea to consider is simply moving together boards used in
the Recon Squad rounds, so that the battle thematically continues
directly over the same terrain.

\paragraph{Schedule.} The Cataclysm runs for a fixed 5 turns.
The organizer should determine and then enforce a schedule within the
time allotted for the match to ensure it completes, setting a specific
number of minutes for each turn.  Remember that later turns tend to go
faster as models have been removed.  A reasonable schedule of alliance
turns for a~\textasciitilde 4 hour period, accommodating setup,
teardown, and scoring, is:

\bigskip
\centerline{\begin{tabular}{cc}
Deployment & 10 minutes each\\
Turn 1& 20 minutes each\\
Turn 2& 20 minutes each\\
Turn 3& 20 minutes each\\
Turn 4& 15 minutes each\\
Turn 5& 15 minutes each\\
\end{tabular}}

\bigskip%
It is also important to ensure that enough time is reserved within
each alliance's turn to resolve the assault phase.  Players and armies
focused on close combat might otherwise be disadvantaged.  The
organizer should make sure alliances move on to close combat with time
to resolve fights as necessary, even if it means cutting short their
other actions.

\paragraph{Team Play.}
Players in an alliance construct and select their own separate army
lists.  Notably, this means teammates do not have to share a faction
keyword and all players in an alliance have designated Warlords.
Teammates combine their forces into a single army just before
deployment.  An alliance is considered a single ``player'' for all
rules puposes from that point.  However, two exceptions are made:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item Casting psychic powers does not restrict teammates' use of them,
  i.e., Psychic Focus isn't communal.  Powers may
  be cast on teammates' forces, following their usual rules.

\item Each player generates and may only use their own pool of
  Command Points.  Stratagems may not be applied to teammates' forces,
  e.g., you cannot give a Command Re-roll.
\end{squishitemize}

\paragraph{Turns.}  Alliance turns are player turns in all ways.  Any
actions not completed within turn time limits are forfeited.  In game
terms, each action happens sequentially as in a standard game: One
unit moves, then another, then the game proceeds to the psychic phase
and no more movements may be made, and so on.  However, in the
interest of time, in practice players with no more actions to take in
a phase should carefully proceed to the subsequent phase, provided
there will be no effect on another player's remaining actions in the
current phase.  Players without actions of their own to complete
should help execute for their teammates, e.g., resolving multiple
unrelated ongoing combats in parallel.  Time \emph{must} be reserved
for the fight phase if there are ongoing combats.

% \paragraph{Scope Limits.}  Special rules that affect all
% units, all enemy units, or the entire table are not applied.  Specific
% examples include the Chaos Daemons' Warp Storm table, the Lord of the
% Storm rules for the Necron's Imotekh the Stormlord, and the Necron
% Solar Pulse, none of which take effect.

% Army-wide buffs apply only to that detachment of that player's forces,
% as in a usual game, regardless of other factions that may be present
% in the alliance.  For example, nominating Vulkan He'stan as a warlord
% makes only that player's Melta weapons in Vulkan's detachment
% Mastercrafted and does not affect any other detachments or players in
% their alliance, including other Salamanders Space Marines.

% \paragraph{Psychic Phase.}  In the psychic phase, a single D6
% is rolled by the current alliance to determine the base warp charge
% from which all of the players generate their own individual pools,
% applying the usual rules to their own models.  Players all use their
% own warp charge pool; teammates cannot combine or share warp charge.
% Any opposing player with models on the table may attempt to deny the
% witch, caveat that if a specific unit of enemy models is targeted,
% their player alone may attempt to block the spell.

\paragraph{Objectives.} If units from multiple players in an alliance
control an objective marker, then each is considered to control it for
puposes of meeting their Cataclysm objectives.  Alliance victory
points are only awarded once though.

\subsection{Scoring and Prizes}

\emph{Legacies} is oriented to casual play but can easily be used for
a narrative tournament.  Prizes should be kept small and well
distributed though to limit the stakes, given that top players may not
face each other if they're in the same alliance, players don't all
contest the same scenarios, some missions are asymmetric, and so on.
There should be two sets of prizes for any gameplay awards, one for
each alliance.  The following section outlines one possible narrative
tournament scoring and prize scheme.

\paragraph{Categories.}
Recommended prizes are:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item Overall winners in each alliance;
\item Painting award by player voting;
\item Best squad leader by game results.
\end{squishitemize}

\paragraph{Overall Scores.} A total of~100 points are available
throughout the campaign:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item 60 points for game results;
\item 20 points for painting and craftwork;
\item 20 points for sportsmanship.
\end{squishitemize}

\clearpage
\paragraph{Game Results.} 

Each of the four Recon Squad missions are worth up to~12 points:

% Major victories award~10 points to the winner and 0 to the not-winner.
% Minor victories award~7 points to the winner and 3 to the not-winner.
% Draws award~5 points to both players.  Each mission has~2 bonus points
% available.

\begin{squishitemize}
\item Major Victory: ~10 points / 0 points;
\item Minor Victory:~7 points / 3 points;
\item Draw:~5 points to both players;
\item 2 possible bonus points.
\end{squishitemize}

%\begin{itemize}\shortlist
%\item Major victories award~10 points to the winner and 0 to the not-winner;
%\item Minor victories award~7 points to the winner and 3 to the not-winner;
%\item Draws award~5 points to both players.
%\item 2 bonus points are available in each mission.
%\end{itemize}

Players may also earn up to~12 points in the Cataclysm toward their
game results:
\begin{squishitemize}
\item 7pts for achieving their personal legacy objective in the Cataclysm;
\item 3pts for earning their legacy bonus with at least~2 Recon Squad wins in
  the appropriate missions and roles;
\item 2pts if their alliance won a tactical victory in the
  Cataclysm (most victory points earned).
\end{squishitemize}

\paragraph{Painting and Craftsmanship.} 

Painting and craft work for each army is scored objectively by the
organizer, awarding 4 points for each of the following:

\begin{squishitemize}
\item All models assembled and primed;
\item All models three-color minimum;
\item All models based (paint/flock);
\item Advanced painting techniques present on any model (washes,
  etc.);
\item Advanced basing techniques present on any model (3D details,
  etc.).
\end{squishitemize}

Note that these points go solely toward overall scores.  The painting
award is based entirely on player voting.

\paragraph{Sportsmanship.}

By default players earn~5 points for sportsmanship in each Recon Squad
round.  However, they may be docked points by an opponent submitting a
ticket for poor behavior:

%\vspace*{-18pt}
\begin{squishitemize}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
\item Openly hostile or rude: \hfill -3 pts
\item Unnecessarily competitive: \hfill -2 pts
\item Sloppy measuring, line of sight checking, or dice handling: \hfill -2 pts
\item Unreasonably late or slow: \hfill -1 pt
\item Overly unfamiliar with rules:
  \hfill -1 pt
\item No clear, typed army lists: \hfill -1 pt
\end{squishitemize}

%\vspace*{-18pt}
Hopefully few or no tickets need be submitted; it's perfectly
acceptable for players to not penalize opponents.  It should be
feasible to supply each player one ticket to start and only give out
more as needed.

\paragraph{Painting Award.}  
Player voting determines the painting award, not painting scores.
Each player submits a ballot of what they consider the three best-made
armies, excluding themselves, giving~3,~2, and~1 votes.  The most
votes wins.
