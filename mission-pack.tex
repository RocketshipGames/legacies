\section{Missions}

\begin{columns}
  
  Army rules, legacies, and missions in this section should be read by
  all players.

\subsection{Campaign Framework}

The campaign consists of four rounds of Recon Squad skirmish matches,
followed by the Cataclysm, a climactic team battle.
The Recon Squad rules are available here:

\smallskip%
The Cataclysm uses standard 40k gameplay, caveat rules for team play.

At the start of the campaign, players join an alliance and choose a
legacy.  Legacies cannot be repeated within an alliance until all have
been chosen.  In each Recon Squad round the alliances alternate
choosing missions from this section.  Players that win at least two of
their legacy's three Recon Squad Missions in the listed roles of
attacker, defender, or either receive their legacy bonus in the
Cataclysm.

\subsection{Army Construction}

Each player must prepare two lists:

\begin{squishitemize}
  \item {Recon Squad:} For the skirmishes;
  \item {Cataclysm:} For the climactic finale.
\end{squishitemize}

Recon Squad lists are selected to at most~200 points, following the
rules in that packet.  Cataclysm lists are selected to at most~500
points by these rules:

  \begin{squishitemize}
  \item Each player's Recon Squad Detachment must be in their
    Cataclysm list.

  \item Additional units and models may be added to the Recon Squad
    Detachment.  The original models may not receive new wargear or
    upgrades.

  \item A single Cataclysm Reinforcements Detachment may be added to
    the army, with a force organization of~0--1 HQ,~1--3 Troop,~0--1
    Elite,~0--1 Fast Attack,~0--1 Heavy Support, and~0--1
    Fortification.  All its units must be chosen from a single
    faction, but that may be a different faction from the Recon Squad
    Detachment.

  \item No models are permitted that have more than~6 wounds.

  \item No models may have both a~2+ Armor and a~3+ Invulnerable save.

  \item No models or wargear are permitted that are restricted to a
    single instance (e.g., named characters).
